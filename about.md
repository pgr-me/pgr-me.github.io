I live in Baltimore as a data scientist / machine learning engineer consultant. I recently got my Master's degree in AI from Johns Hopkins University.

I grew up in Iowa and have lived in New Orleans, Massachusetts, Kenya, and DC. I now reside in Baltimore. I love the Nebraska Cornhuskers, practice yoga, tend to listen to lots of post-punk / new wave music, and am a news and politics junkie.
